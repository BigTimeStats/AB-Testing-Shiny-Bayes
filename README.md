### Bayesian A/B Testing

Code repository that visualizes A/B Test results using a simulated beta distribution and ecdf on the same chart via ggplot2 in R.

Useful to measure click-through rate A/B tests to visualize distribution of possible lift, as well as the probability that the test CTR > control CTR

### Example Plot Output & Interpretation

Control CTR = 25%,

Control Trials = 100

Test CTR = 35%,

Test Trials = 100

![Sample Plot](Rplot.png)

The histogram shows the distribution of simulated Test CTR's / Control CTR's to visualize potential Test lift.

The line shows the cumulative distribution. This can be used to quantify the probability of a certain lift. For example, in the above plot, there is a 50% chance that the test group will exhibit a lift of 40% or more (the median effect, same as (.35 - .25) / .25).

The line intercept at x = 0% shows the probability that the test group will underperform the control group, or ~ 6.5%. 1 - .065 = 93.5%, or the probability that the test group will overperform the control group. 

A p-value can be derived from the line intercept at 0, or ~.065 above. This is the probability of observing at least as extreme test statistic (i.e. difference from control given the null hypothesis distribution), given that the control CTR is true.

Classically, a statistically significant result (typically, p < .05) tells us that 2 values are not likely the same (i.e. not from the same distribution). However, we may want to know how much better the test group will perform. The plotted distribution gives a probabilistic view of that lift.


### Shiny App

![Shiny](ShinyApp2.png)

The shiny app takes all of the above, allows a user to input custom A/B test results, adds the Bayesian Probability that Test > Control, and computes the p-value using a single tailed t-test (Classical Hypothesis Test).

1 - the Bayesian Probability is within range of the classically computed p-value, which is expected. 

Some benefits of the app:
1. Visualize possible outcomes probabilistically.
2. Not have to determine sample size ahead of time, nor wait for a test to be "statistically significant"
3. Allow inputs of prior knowledge of the control/test distribution, which will adjust evidence needed to overturn control (not applicable to p-value calculation by design)


One limitation of the R ggplotly package (interactive plot) is that it does not have the capability to visualize a secondary axis. A user can hover over the line values to see the Cumulative Probability.
