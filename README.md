### Bayesian AB Testing

Code repository that visualizes simulated beta distribution histogram and ecdf plots on the same chart via ggplot2 in R.

Useful to contruct A/B tests in practice to measure simulated distributions and potential effect sizes.

### Example Plot Output

p1 = .25,
n1 = 125

p2 = .35,
n2 = 125
