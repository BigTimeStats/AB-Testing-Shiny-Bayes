### Bayesian AB Testing

Based on work at: <a href="https://www.countbayesie.com/blog/2015/4/25/bayesian-ab-testing" target="_blank">Count Bayesie Bayesian AB Testing</a>  

Code repository that visualizes simulated beta distribution histogram and ecdf plots on the same chart via ggplot2 in R.

Useful to measure click-through rate A/B tests to visualize distribution of possible effects, as well as the probability that the test CTR > control CTR

### Example Plot Output

p1 = .25,
n1 = 125

p2 = .35,
n2 = 125
